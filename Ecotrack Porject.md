My idea is EcoTrack which is a Wildlife Conservation and Monitoring Platform. EcoTrack is a comprehensive wildlife conservation and monitoring platform that aims to aid researchers, conservationists, and wildlife enthusiasts. The platform allows users to track, monitor, and analyze the movements and behaviors of various animal species in their natural habitats. The data collected from this platform can be used to create conservation strategies, assess the impact of human activity, and promote awareness about wildlife conservation. EcoTrack will integrate data from various sources such as wildlife cameras, GPS trackers, and manual observations. The platform will utilize Python for data processing, analysis, and visualization. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, EcoTrack will identify and classify animal species from images or videos captured by wildlife cameras. Additionally, the platform will analyze the collected GPS data to determine the movement patterns, home ranges, and critical habitats of tracked animals. It will also have a community platform for users to upload pictures and locations of wildlife they encounter on any trips or explorations they are on. 
Key features of EcoTrack include: 
Animal identification and classification using machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques.
    Integration of GPS tracking data for studying animal movement patterns.
    Visualization of animal movement data on interactive maps.
    Analysis of habitat use and identification of critical habitats for conservation planning.
    Collaboration tools for researchers and conservationists to share data, findings, and insights.
    Online Community discussion board, on both the ecotrack website and possibly have a subreddit. 

The users of EcoTrack will primarily be wildlife researchers, conservationists, and wildlife enthusiasts who want to monitor and protect animal species in their natural habitats. But other outsiders who want to contribute their knowledge to the research are welcome to put in their experiences such as pictures or videos.  The platform will be a valuable tool for conservation organizations, researchers, and governments working on wildlife conservation projects.
The following are some relevant sources that can be used as a starting point for the development of EcoTrack:

    Wildlife image classification using TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification
    GPS data processing and analysis with Python: https://geopandas.org/
    Interactive maps using Folium: https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/


EcoTrack can be developed by one individual.
